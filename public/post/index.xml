      <description>I thought the Needleman-Wunsch algorithms were interesting to learn about, since I had never heard of them. It makes sense that something like this would exist, even if only for testing amino acids/base pair similarity/alignments. Honestly, it was kind of fun to fill in the alignment matrix by hand. But obviously, this becomes very tedious when you have really long sequences, so being able to do it in Python was very helpful.</description>
