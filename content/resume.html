<p>Hello! My name is Aakansha Bagepally, and I’m currently a third-year student pursuing an Honors B.S.A in Biology and a B.A in Government as a double major at the University of Texas at Austin, with a minor in Asian American Studies. I’m in the Polymathic Scholars Honors Program, an interdisciplinary honors program for students in the College of Natural Sciences that includes an Evidence and Inquiry Certificate. As part of this program, I will be writing an honors thesis based on the reproductive health within immigrant communities in the US. I’m interested in the intersections of health and immigration inequalities, policy, and medicine. Here is my <a href="/AkshaBagepallyResume.pdf">resume</a> if you’d like to link up!</p>
