<p>I thought the Needleman-Wunsch algorithms were interesting to learn about, since I had never heard of them. It makes sense that something like this would exist, even if only for testing amino acids/base pair similarity/alignments. Honestly, it was kind of fun to fill in the alignment matrix by hand. But obviously, this becomes very tedious when you have really long sequences, so being able to do it in Python was very helpful. Below, I’ve included some of the code we used to get alignments for given sequences. The match score was 2, mismatch score -1, and the gap penalty was -1. The sequences were GATCCCT and ATTTCGATC.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np

def match_fun(a,b):
    if a==b:
        score=2 #match score
    else:
        score=-1 #mismatch score
    return score

def needleman(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1):
    m=len(seq1)
    n=len(seq2)
    score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1])
    for j in range(0, m + 1): score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j
    for i in range(0, n + 1): score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            insert = score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty 
            delete = score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty 
            match = score[i - 1][j - 1] + match_fun(seq1[j-1], seq2[i-1])
            score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
    return score

x1=&quot;GATCCCT&quot;
x2=&quot;ATTTCGATC&quot;

mat=needleman(x1,x2)


def get_alignment(seq1,seq2,mat,gap_penalty=-1):
    j=len(seq1) #length of horizontal sequence
    i=len(seq2) #length of vertical sequence
    AlignA=&quot;&quot;   #empty strings to hold alignments
    AlignB=&quot;&quot;
    while i &gt; 0 or j &gt; 0:  #start at the bottom right corner: if from diagonal, align sequences
        if i &gt; 0 and j &gt; 0 and mat[i,j]==mat[i-1][j-1]+match_fun(seq1[j-1],seq2[i-1]):
            AlignA = seq1[j-1] + AlignA
            AlignB = seq2[i-1] + AlignB
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif j &gt; 0 and mat[i,j]==mat[i][j-1]+gap_penalty: #if from above, put gap in vertical sequence
            AlignA = seq1[j-1] + AlignA
            AlignB = &quot;-&quot; + AlignB
            j -= 1
        else:                             #if from the left, put gap in horizontal sequence
            AlignA = &quot;-&quot; + AlignA
            AlignB = seq2[i-1]+AlignB
            i -= 1
    return AlignA, AlignB #return both alignments

get_alignment(x1,x2,mat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## (&#39;GA--TCCCT-&#39;, &#39;-ATTTCGATC&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We can see the returned alignments are GA–TCCCT- and -ATTTCGATC.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to trying to study to for my Organic Chemistry exam! Happy finals!</p>
